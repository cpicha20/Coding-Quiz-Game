## Coding-Quiz-Game

UCF Coding Bootcamp Week 2 Challange 2. 

This project was to test my collective javascript, css, and html skills to make a short little coding quiz. It took alot of time but Im pretty proud of it. You can take the quiz by hitting the play button, afterwards you can save your name and score to local storage and check the leaderboards with the highscore button. Thank you for checking out my page and have fun.
